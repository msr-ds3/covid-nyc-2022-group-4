You will need to download a csv file for some zip code data.
covid testing data taken originally from:
https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/097cbd70aa00eb635b17b177bc4546b2fce21895/tests-by-zcta.csv

Other than that, all other downloads are facilitated by the code.
Just run the Warren_Navpreet_turn_in.Rmd file in RStudio.
